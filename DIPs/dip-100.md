# Summary
Implementation of NFT(Non-fungible tokens) standard interface on DDN.

# Abstract
NFT is the abbreviation of non-fungible token. It is mainly issued by erc-721 standard, created by Dieter Shirley at 2017-09-20. Then Dieter and his team launched the encryption game "CryptoKitties", which became the most popular application of Ethereum at that time.

Dieter's innovation is to introduce scarcity into the concept of cryptocurrency. The main characteristics of NFT are uniqueness and indivisibility. Each non-homogeneous token is different. It is a unique token and cannot be replaced by each other. In addition, the minimum unit of NFT is 1, which cannot be split. This means that your NFT cannot be exchanged with other people's NFT, nor can it be split into 0.1. The common BTC, eth and DDN can also have 0.001, but the unit of non homogenous token can only be 1, which cannot be split into 0.01. Just like concert tickets, there is no concept of half ticket.

# Motivation
NFT with standard interface is implemented on DDN, which can be processed in a common way in general applications. It can be tracked by standard wallet and traded in the exchange. In particular, the standard is compatible with erc721, so the contract code on ethereum can be easily transplanted.
